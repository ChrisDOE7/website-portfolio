               Welcome to my website! I'm Chris and I'm just learning how to
               create stunning web content. A new and exciting topic that I
               would like to explore as soon as possible is the world of
               automations. In short "bots". Everybody who is often and gladly
               on the web has his certain procedures, which are already
               subconsciously stored in a form of automation. Every interaction
               with the computer that starts from us wastes precious time,
               because the human brain first has to absorb the received
               information, then process it and finally react to it. Let's turn
               our disadvantage into an advantage and let the machine do the
               tedious work, so that we ourselves have more time for the
               important things.

               My name is Christopher Sean de Oliveira Eberhard and I'm based in
               Berlin. I am a father of two clever princess and a husband to one
               phenomenal brazilian.
               <br />
               I started my career as a retail salesman at Telekom AG in Germany
               and was able to gain a lot of valuable experience there.
               <br />
               However, I realized very early on that retail wasn't really
               fulfilling for me, so I ventured into new waters. I quickly found
               myself in the restaurant business as a bar manager and waiter and
               was able to live out one of my greatest passions on a different
               level. Process optimization and customer management.
               <br />
               It was an exciting and good time, but even here it becomes
               increasingly difficult with time and especially with age to
               discover new opportunities to be able to develop further.
               <br />
               It was inevitable that I would take up my childhood hobby again
               and pursue a career in this field.
               <br />
               From an early age I was enthusiastic about computers. At the age
               of 10, now 36, I got an Amiga from my uncle for my birthday and a
               new, exciting world opened up in front of me.
               <br />
               With two moving boxes full of floppy disks I was busy enough to
               find out what you could do with such a wonder device of
               technology. The excitement never waned. Only certain factors
               distracted me from turning my hobby into a profession.
               <br />
               But it's never too late, right? That's why you're reading this
               little article now, because I decided to become a web developer.

                        Customer care has always been the most exciting part of
                        the job for me. From getting to know them, to settling
                        on a common level and delivering the final product,
                        nowhere have I experienced more variety and clear
                        feedback.

                        Inevitable for a fluent and productive workflow. I
                        became much more aware of this as I worked in the food
                        service industry. Because here, multiple teams have to
                        deliver a perfect product in the shortest amount of
                        time. Otherwise, you might lose the customer. So time is
                        your biggest enemy. Even the smallest
                        micro-optimizations can lead to big improvements at the
                        end of the day.

                        In 2020, I jumped in at the deep end and successfully
                        completed a web developer course a year later with top
                        marks. Thereby I gained an extensive knowledge around
                        the topic of web development. Taking into account the
                        "mobile-first" method, I wrote my first responsive
                        website including small javascript content. You can find
                        it in my
                        <a href="http://https://github.com/ChrisDOE7">Github</a>
                        profile.

                        My desire is first to acquire a fundamental basic
                        knowledge and the corresponding self-confidence in the
                        use around the topic Javascript. I have already dared to
                        program a bot with NodeJS, but I have reached a point
                        where I realized that my current level of knowledge is
                        not sufficient to advance this small project of mine.
