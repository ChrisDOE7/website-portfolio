            <p>
               Welcome to my website! I'm Chris and I'm just learning how to
               create stunning web content. A new and exciting topic that I
               would like to explore as soon as possible is the world of
               automations. In short "Bots". Everybody who is often and gladly
               on the web has his certain procedures, which are already
               subconsciously stored in a form of automation. Every interaction
               with the computer that requires a manual reaction is (for the
               computer) wasted time, because the human brain first has to
               absorb the received information, then process it and finally
               react to it. Let's turn our disadvantage into an advantage and
               let the machine do some of the tedious work itself, so that we
               ourselves have more time for the important things.

                        Customer care has always been the most exciting part of
                        the job for me. From getting to know them, to settling
                        on a common level and delivering the final product,
                        nowhere have I experienced more variety and clear
                        feedback.

                        Inevitable for a fluent and productive workflow. I
                        became much more aware of this as I worked in the food
                        service industry. Because here, multiple teams have to
                        deliver a perfect product in the shortest amount of
                        time. Otherwise, you might lose the customer. So time is
                        your biggest enemy. Even the smallest
                        micro-optimizations can lead to big improvements at the
                        end of the day.

                        In 2020, I jumped in at the deep end and successfully
                        completed a web developer course a year later with top
                        marks. Thereby I gained an extensive knowledge around
                        the topic of web development. Taking into account the
                        "mobile-first" method, I wrote my first responsive
                        website including small javascript content. You can find
                        it in my
                        <a href="http://https://github.com/ChrisDOE7">Github</a>
                        profile.

                        My desire is first to acquire a fundamental basic
                        knowledge and the corresponding self-confidence in the
                        use around the topic Javascript. I have already dared to
                        program a bot with NodeJS, but I have reached a point
                        where I realized that my current level of knowledge is
                        not sufficient to advance this small project of mine.
